# HGTP's Roblox Corruptor
### Info
A little experiment made by me to show you what corrupting a Roblox game would look like.
This script doesn't actually corrupt the game, it instead modifies the game workspace.
Not sure what workspace is? Workspace is the Roblox term for the world your character plays in.

### WARNING
##### NOT MADE FOR CHEATING!!!
Some games uses anti-cheats, use a alt account!
Recommended to use this script in a private server!
I don't take responsibility if you get banned from Roblox or in any game!

### What This Can Do
Modify the transform of workspace objects,
Mess with lighting,
Edit the camera,
Change colors of workspace objects,
Tinker with UI,
Mess with sounds,
Etc.

### How Do I Use
First, you need to be flamiliar with Roblox executors.
Reccomended getting one from "wearedevs.com".
Once you have your executor open, join a game and run the loadstring below.
Once the UI finished loading, look at the info on the right of it.

## Loadstring
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HGthepublisher/HGTPs-Roblox-Corruptor/refs/heads/main/Corruptor.lua"))
